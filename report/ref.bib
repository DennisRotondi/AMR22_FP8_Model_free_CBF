abstract = {The classic text on robot manipulators now covers visual control, motion planning and mobile robots too! Robotics provides the basic know-how on the foundations of robotics: modelling, planning and control. The text develops around a core of consistent and rigorous formalism with fundamental and technological material giving rise naturally and with gradually increasing difficulty to more advanced considerations. The theory of manipulator structures presented in the early part of the book encompasses: the fundamentals: kinematics, statics and trajectory planning; and the technology of actuators, sensors and control units. Subsequently, more advanced instruction is given in: dynamics and motion control of robot manipulators; mobile robots; motion planning; and interaction with the environment using exteroceptive sensory data (force and vision). Appendices ensure that students will have access to a consistent level of background in basic areas such as rigid-body mechanics, feedback control, and others. Problems are raised and the proper tools established to find engineering-oriented solutions rather than to focus on abstruse theoretical methodology. To impart practical skill, more than 60 examples and case studies are carefully worked out and interwoven through the text, with frequent resort to simulation. In addition, nearly 150 end-of-chapter problems are proposed, and the book is accompanied by a solutions manual (downloadable from www.springer.com/978-1-84628-641-4) containing the MATLAB code for computer problems; this is available free of charge to those adopting Robotics as a textbook for courses. This text is suitable for use in senior undergraduate and graduate courses in automation and computer, electrical, electronic and mechanical engineering courses with strong robotics content.}

  abstract={This paper considers the problem of guaranteeing avoidance of critical state space regions during tracking of reference trajectories for systems with dynamics equivalent to r-th order decoupled integrators. The necessity to avoid those critical regions during trajectory tracking may arise during the transient phase or because the reference trajectory was planned without taking into account the presence of those critical regions. A typical problem in mobile robotics, taken as reference in this paper, is the avoidance of obstacles in the robot workspace during tracking of reference state space trajectories. The proposed controller ensures a safety clearance from the forbidden regions by filtering out, when appropriate, the component of the tracking command that would eventually lead the system to enter the critical region. The method relies on the construction of first-order control barrier functions and closed-form controllers, with formal proof of safety and stability, and its effective application to wheeled mobile robots and quadrotors is demonstrated through simulation.},
