\section{Simulations}
We have conducted MATLAB simulations using Simulink to compare the performance of the model-free with classical approaches under different modeling inaccuracies, while holding the other robot parameters constant. Eventually we have also carried out trials in which the required theorem assumptions on the dynamics were not fully satisfied, to evaluate the model-free approach.

\subsection{Double Integrator}
As the simplest instantiation of \eqref{eq:dynamic model}, let us consider a double integrator with dynamic model: 
\begin{equation}
    \Mm\ddot{\qv} = \Bm\uv
\end{equation}
where $\qv \in \mathbb{R}^2$ represents the planar position of the robot and $\uv \in \mathbb{R}^2$, the torque commands.
%A possible unsafe tracking controller which allows the robot to go from $\qv_{start}$ to $\qv_{goal}$ without taking into account the obstacles is given by :
We are going to solve the problem of navigating the system from $\qv_{start}$ to $\qv_{goal}$ while avoiding obstacles, firstly,  in a model-free fashion and, then, in the classical full-model based approach.
We work with multiple obstacles with  different dimensions.
\subsubsection{Model-free}
\textbf{Model-free Approach}:
A solution which allows to navigate the system from $\qv_{start}$ to $\qv_{goal}$ without taking into account the obstacles consists in realizing the desired velocity $\dot{\qv}_{goal}$:   
\begin{equation}
    \dot{\qv}_{goal}=-K_p(\qv - \qv_{goal}),\,K_p\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}
\end{equation}
 We can avoid an obstacle of radius $R$ centered at $\qv_O$ by defining $d = \lVert \qv-\qv_O \rVert$ and the CBF:
\begin{equation}
h(\qv)=d-R
\end{equation}
with gradient $\nabla h(\qv) = \frac{\qv-\qv_O}{d} = \nv_0^T$ with the unit vector $\nv_0$ pointing from the obstacle to the robot. Then, we modify $\dot{\qv}_{goal}$ in a minimally invasive fashion by solving the quadratic optimization program:
\begin{align}
    &\argmin_{\dot{\qv}_{safe} \in \mathbb{R}^2} \,\,(\dot{\qv}_{safe}-\dot{\qv}_{goal})^T(\dot{\qv}_{safe}-\dot{\qv}_{goal}) \notag\\
    &\mathrm{s.t} \,\,\, \nv_0^T \dot{\qv}_{safe}\geq -\alpha(d-R)
\end{align}
Then, by defining $\xv = \dot{\qv}, \xv_{safe}=\dot{\qv}_{safe}$, the safe velocity tracking controller $\uv = K_d (\xv - \xv_{goal}), K_d \in \mathbb{R}_{>0} $ guarantees the asynptotic convergence of $\xv$ to $\xv_{safe}$. \\
\textbf{Remark 1.} The double integrator system avoids the obstacles, although the second-order dynamics was not directly taken into account during the CBF and control design. It follows that the CBF has relative degree $1$ with respect to $y = \qv$ if we are assuming to control the robot in velocities i.e. $\dot{\qv}=\vv$. \\
\textbf{Remark 2.} The condition for safety consists in picking a small enough $\alpha$-value (e.g $0.1$,$0.2$).
